### Unemployment in Madrid
*For this dashboard I have used data from the [**Public Database of the Madrid City Council**](https://servpub.madrid.es/CSEBD_WBINTER/seleccionSerie.html?numSerie=0904010000014) 

In these tables you can see the data arranged both in map and clustered bar chart and a card with the total percentage. I have introduced slicers to be able to filter by age groups, month, gender and district/neighborhood. 
On the other hand, I have added a button to switch from the district view to the neighborhood view and vice versa.
